Note that partially ordered sets, or posets, are isomorphic to directed
acyclic graphs, or DAGs. A poset's elements are a DAG's vertices, and the
less-than-or-equal relation becomes the path relation. This isomorphism
actually relates a poset to a family of DAGs. We will select the transitive
reduction from amongst them; this is the smallest member of the family. (Proof
of all of this is left to the reader.)

We can represent a poset/DAG as an upper triangular matrix in the Booleans.
The matrix's rows and columns are the elements/vertices, and each member of
the matrix indicates whether there is an arrow from the given row-element to
the given column-element. To ensure that there are no arrows outside the upper
triangular region, the elements must be ordered as a linear extension, also
known as a topological sorting.

As an example, suppose we have a poset with three elements, X, Y, and Z, and
arrows X -> Y and X -> Z.

A valid linear extension is [ X Y Z ]. The resulting matrix is:

[ 1 1 1 ]
[ 0 1 0 ]
[ 0 0 1 ]

Note that all elements relate to themselves, so that the diagonal is
implicitly always 1.

[ \ 1 1 ]
[   \ 0 ]
[     \ ]

\11
 \0
  \

Thus, we may store any poset/DAG as a bitstring and a cardinality of elements.
